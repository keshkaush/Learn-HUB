/*
Linked list is a  data structure often used to store
similar data in memory. 
Unlike the elements of an array, linked list
are not constrained to be stored in adjacent location. 
Individual nodes of a L.L are dispersed in memory but bonded together.  
Thus, a linked list is a collection of elements called
nodes, each of which stores two item of informationâ€”an
element of the list, and a link.
